# COSC 499 Git exercise

In this assignment we will show the professor how we can use github and git to work with others in a coding project by using git functions such as push, pull, merge and etc. I will now show what code I have written for this assignment which entails a array sorting with 2 functions.

## Function 1 - String Sort or quickString():
This first function takes an array of strings and will sort it using a quicksort algorithm by sorting the strings in a alphabetical matter.

## Function 2 - Int sort or intsorter():
This second function takes in a array of numbers and quicksorts them in a manner where it goes from smallest to largest. 

## MainSort:
This is where you can find the array of names and the random int array. Both of these can be manipulated in way where you can have more in the array or less.
